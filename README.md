Due to the large number of car parks and the manpower crunch, it is essential that we leverage technology as well as the power of the masses, to enhance and optimise the HDB car park’s maintenance system.

Introducing LotCare, a mobile application for car park maintenance management for HDB residents and maintenance staff. LotCare acts as a seamless platform for residents to stay updated on maintenance works while empowering them to be involved in the upkeep of their neighbourhood car parks. It also introduces an element of gamification and engagement by including user profiles and leaderboards to foster greater community spirit between residents.
